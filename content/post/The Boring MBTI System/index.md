I thought it would be helpful to describe how my attitude towards MBTI has changed over the past few months.

While the MBTI framework offers a compelling way to understand personality patterns, it ultimately simplifies the complexity of human behavior into static categories.

People are dynamic, and their thoughts, actions, and motivations often shift with context, age, and experience. There are also huge differences between people in their ability and degree to control their thoughts. Therefore the binary system created by MBTI is an extremely simplified system that is easy to understand but is not true.

I think we must take into account the complexity of the system and try to conduct research in a more fitting way. Classification will inevitably lead to bias, and this bias in the MBTI system has the probability of stereotyping people.

The limitations of the MBTI are already quite obvious, and it is clear that it constrains many people, both in terms of behavior and potential. I tend to believe that individuals are unique and special, and trying to describe all individuals using 16 types is a very simplified and easy to understand way, which is what makes it so popular, but it does not represent its accuracy.

People always want something to be fixed, but reality is often dynamic. It is understandable that seeking to fix reality is a lazy behavior, and this is also true for psychological research.

This is a good example of individual peculiarity.
