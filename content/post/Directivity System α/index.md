It is necessary to do something new in the new year. The efficiency research in 2023 has not even made any progress on paper, and the low efficiency is amazing...

I plan to combine the methods of summarizing and experimenting in 2022 and 2023 and the latest theoretical results into a system that can promote efficiency improvement.

This is the Directivity system.

It will be built on Obsidian and combined with a complete knowledge base to form an effective workflow.
## Overview

Annual plan for 2024 is created based on [[Directivity system α]] and will be committed to providing goal orientation for the whole year.

## Directivity System α

1. **Long-lasting plan**
**Long-lasting plan** is the overall plan, which is a long-term ideal plan and overall goal. **Long-lasting plan** plans take a certain amount of time to complete because of their long time span.

2. **Annual plan**
**Annual plan** will provide an index for each year's goals and judge the work status of the whole year based on this.

3. **Monthly plan/Weekly plan**
**Monthly plan** will refine the annual goal arrangement to get monthly and weekly goals.

4. **Day results**
**Day results** As the most basic unit, it no longer uses the planning method, but directly counts the results, which is conducive to the visualization of the results and goal progress.
## What's NEW

- Annual plan for 2024 systematizes goals, plans, and results for the first time, making them measurable.

- Annual plan for 2024 will replace Todo list with **Result list**, **Result list** is the result of "committed to production", while most Todo lists usually exist separately from the commitment to produce results.

- Annual plan for 2024 is also the first practice of Directivity system α. This will help you notice the most important results. Then focus on the upcoming time frame.
## Main
#### Theoretical basis:

- **Extremely Efficiency** : After a year of research on work efficiency, Paramount efficiency theory has been proven to be the key to efficient work completion. In 2024, **Extremely Efficiency** will inherit this and use it as a basis for rapid iteration and practice of various theories.

- **Endorphins and long-termism**: Increase endorphins and reduce dopamine through **long-termism** and sustainable actions. Physical and mental health is the basis for achieving goals, and long-term persistence in action and maintaining high efficiency can lead to better results and endorphin income.

- **Result oriented**: One of the biggest changes in 2024 is to change from plan-oriented to result-oriented. Results are evaluated directly by goals, rather than by whether the plan is completed. Result orientation pays more attention to the direct connection between the completed content and the goal, so as to know where you are.

- **Rapid iteration and experimentalism**: **Rapid iteration** can quickly improve the unreasonable aspects of theory or practice, and quickly improve through continuous trial and error to achieve the final results. **experimentalism** is the biggest helper when facing unknown theories or events. Many theories are not universal, so it is necessary to build methods and systems that belong only to you.

- **First principles** : First principles thinking helps to find the root of the problem and avoid useless work and superficial solutions.

- **Feynman** : The Feynman learning method aims to repeat facts and principle knowledge to discover and determine whether the content has been mastered.

- **Time Boxing** : The **Time Boxing** working method aims to divide time into small enough bars for allocation and planning
