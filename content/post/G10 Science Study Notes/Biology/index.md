# Part I - 1.1 DNA & RNA

1. DNA 
   **Is the genetic material that stores information**
   **Is responsible for all the variation in living things**
   **found in nucleus of a cell** 
   **Genetic variation is the differences between DNA of individuals within a population**
‎ 
2. Nucleic Acids
   **There biopolymers or small biomolecules essential to all known forms of life**
   **Cells contain two types of Nucleic Acids:** 
   **DNA - Deoxyribonucleic Acid**
   **RNA - Ribonucleic Acid**
‎ 
3. Nucleotides
 **Consist of a phosphate group, a sugar and a nitrogen base found in DNA & RNA**
**These smaller components make up the molecules of Nucleic Acids**
- **Nitrogenous base**
- **sugar**
- **Phosphate**
4. Nitrogenous Base
   **Part of the structure of nucleotides**
   $$
   Adenine (A) - Thymine (T)
   $$
   $$
   Cytosine (C) - Guanine (G)
   $$
   ‎ 
5. Complementary Base Sharing
   **Nitrogenous bases that bond or pair together**
   **Adenine - Always pairs with Thymine**
   **Guanine - Always pairs with Cytosine**
   ‎ 
6. DNA's function
   **DNA stores genetic information**
   **Organisms inherit DNA from their biological parents**
   **This genetic information tells each cell what proteins to make and how to make them**
‎ 
7. Genes
   **Contain instructions for making proteins, which are molecules made up of subunits called amino acids**
   **Various proteins control how a cell is formed and how it functions**
   **The instruction provided by DNA are therefore responsible for the development of a organism**
   ‎ 
8. Genome
   **The complete DNA sequence in each cell of an organism**
   **Human genome consists of 3 billion base pairs**
   ‎ 
9. Chromosomes
   **DNA usually exists in the form of chromatin. During cell division, the chromatin condenses into structures called chromosomes**
   **Human has 46 chromosomes and 23 pairs**
   - **23 chromosomes come from the biological father and 23 from the biological father and 23 from the biological mother**
   - **22 of these are called Autosomes**
   - **The last pair is the sex chromosome**
‎ 
10. Sex Chromosomes
**The X & Y chromosomes**
- **X & Y - Genetic male**
- **X & X - Genetic female**
**The last pair of human chromosomes**

11. DNA replication
- **Enzymes cut nitrogenous bases, DNA split into 2 strands**
- **Each of the DNA stands act as a template for the formation of a complementary strand**
- **The instructions for a protein are copied on to a RNA molecule which is then used to make the protein**
- **The end result is 2 DNA molecules that are identical to the original**

12. Biodiversity 
- ***Species Diversity* - The variety and abundance of a group of organisms that can inbreed in a give area**
 - ***Genetic Diversity* - Variety of characteristics that are expressed within a species**
  **e.x. The patterns on the tail of humpback wails**
- ***Ecosystem Diversity* - The rich diversity of ecosystems found on earth, each of which contain many species**
# Part II - 1.2 DNA & RNA

13. Genetics
**A field of Biology that studies heredity**
‎ 
14. Heredity
**The passing of traits from parents to offspring**
Early Experiments, including growing and raising food crops and companion animals
‎ 
15. Gregor Mendel
**In the 1860's he experimented with pea plants and discovered how traits can be passed from one generation to another**
‎ 
16. Self <u>pollination</u>
**When a male gamete within a flower combines with a female gamete in the same plant**
‎ 
17. Cross <u>pollination</u>
**When a male gamete of one plant combines with a female gametes of another**
**By deliberately cross pollinating plants he could control certain traits produced by the offspring**
‎ 
18. Mendel's Experiments
**Purple and white flowered plants**
**When they self pollinized they would produce offspring of the same color**
‎ 
19. Ture Breeding Plants
**Plants that consistently produce offspring with only one form of trait**
- **Homozygous Chromosomes**
$$
(PP) \text{ }or\text{ } (pp)
$$

- **(PP) Dominant**
- **(pp) Recessive**

![[B-6.png]]

- **Each plant had two factors that act as a set of instructions for each trait**
- **Each parent donates one of these factors to the offspring**
- **One factor or trait may *dominate* over the other if present**

20. Incomplete Dominance
**A condition were neither of the two alleles for the same gene can completely control the presence of the other**
**Incomplete Dominance a heterozygous shows a phenotype that is *between both phenotypes***
‎ 
21. Sex Linked Traits
**Traits controlled by genes located on the sex chromosomes**
‎ 
22. X linked Traits
**Traits controlled by the genes on the X chromosome**
**Color Vision Deficiency - A person that sees red and green as shades of gray**

![[Pasted image 20240724181439.png]]

23. Codominance
**In codominance both alleles are fully expressed with one capital letter for the gene with different subscript letters for each allele**
‎ 
24. Roan
**Result of codominance**
**A roan animal is a *heterozygous* in which both the base color (red and white) are fully expressed**
‎ 
25. Sickle Cell Anemia
**Sickle cell anemia is another example of *codominance***
**Its caused by a specific form of the gene that directs the synthesis of hemoglobin** 
**Hemoglobin is a protein in the development of red blood cells**

![[B-5.png]]

**Sickle Cell Anemia causes people to have shaped (sickled shaped) red blood cells. These blood cells do not transport oxygen efficiently. Causing blockages and tissue damage. They also don't fit through small blood vessels.**
‎ 
25. Sickle all anemia and vessels

**An allele that masks the presence of a *recessive allele* in the *phenotype*** 
‎ 
30. Recessive Allele
**An allele that is masked in the *phenotype* by the presence of the *dominant allele***
**Recessive alleles are only expressed in a phenotype when the genotype is homozygous recessive**
$$
(pp)
$$
31. Phenotype
**The observation or detectable characteristics of an Individual organism**
**The detectable expression of the genotype**

# Part III - 1.3 Natural & Artificial Selection

34. Mutation
**Changes in the DNA of an organism, caused by mutagens**
**Creates *genetic diversity* - Provides new alleles and are a source of new genetic information**
**Conditions - Cell divides or environment agents (Ultraviolet), can be *harmful or beneficial***
‎ 
35. Mutagen
**Is a substance or an event that increase the rate if mutations**
***harmful or beneficial***
- ***Physical* - Change DNA structure**
**Ultraviolet radiation, Xray**
- ***Chemical* - Enter nuclear and react with DNA**
**Nitrates, Gasoline fumes, Preservative, Cigarette **

36.  Selective Advantages
**Genetic advantage of one organism over its competitors**
**Over time, the selected advantage is a genetic advantage to be favored in terms of *survival and reproduction***
‎ 
37. Natural Selection
   **Best adapted members of a species survive and reproduce**
   **They have favorable characteristics to give to their offspring**
‎ 
38. Adaptation
**Helps a organism survive and reproduce in a particular environment**

	The process of natural selection means that if there is such a that helps the population survive or produce, it will be inherited to the offspring survivors. As a result, over many generations, they will be more and more individuals with that inherited alliance. These individuals form a population better suitable to the environment.

39. Speciation
**During speciation, a new species is formed from existing population**
**As natural selection occurs, populations can diverge from each other to such a extent that they create a new species.**
**They can no longer create fertile offspring**
‎ 
40. Geographical (varies)
**Sometimes species can get cut off from one another graphically**

	Over time, natural selection and other factors act on mutations in each population, producing new traits that are advantageous to individuals in their environment and are passed from one generation to the next
	Given enough time, the populations will differ so much, and they become a new species

41. Adaptive Radiation
**As the environment change, organisms can undergo adaptive radiation. This is when common *ancestors* split into different species**
**Island is a good example because it isolated the population and forces them to adapt to the environment.**
‎  
42. Extinction
**Extinction occurs when a species completely disappeares from the Earth**
Environmental influence create **selective pressure** and these influence can either **create a new species** or **existing new species may go extinct**
‎ 
43. Carcinogen
**Are mutagens that causes cancer**

	e.x. - increase exposure to ultraviolet rays increase the chances of skin cancer, smoking can increase chains of lung cancer

44. Artificial Selection
**Selective pressure exerted by *humans* on population in order to improve or modify desirable traits**
**Also call this *artificial breeding***
**Most of food we eat grains, fruits, vegetables, meat and milk comes from a species we have selectively bred**
**Artificial selections has caused cows to produce more milk, chicken have been bred to grow faster**
‎ 
45. Artificial Selection in food crops
***Rice, corn, wheat and vegetables* are a result of selective breedings**
**Human started artificially breeding plants 4000 years ago in *Europe and Asia***
**We have created crops resistant to drought, disease resistant and pest resistant**

![[B-2.jpg]]

46. Negative Consequences
**Decrease genetic diversity**
**Risks from monoculture**
‎ 
47. Monoculture
**Extensive plantings of the same varieties of a species over vast land**
‎
48. Polyculture
**Extensive plantings of the different varieties of a species over vast land**
‎
49. English Bulldogs
**Selectively bred them to have flat faces. Now they have respiratory (breathe) issue**
‎ 
50. German Shepard
**In our quest to increase their size we have created his dysplasia (no enough nutrition)**
‎ 
51. Crops
**Monocultures increase their risk from environmental or pest changes**
