$$
**Earth tilt, axis of rotation and orbit around the Sun-Earth experiences seasonal changes due to a combination of its tilt and orbit. When the Earth's rotation angle is between 22.1 and 24.5, the Earth's tilt is greatest, changing the angle of the incidence**

65.      Water Cycle (C.P.E.T)

**Circulation of water on, above and under the earth surface**

- ***Condensation*-As the water vapor rises in the atmosphere, it gains gravitational potential energy. It also releases thermal energy to air molecules through collisions. It then cools, condenses around particles in the atmosphere and form clouds. The condensation process more thermal energy to the atmosphere.**
- ***Precipitation*- The water returns to Earth's surface through precipitation when it rains or snows, as the precipitation falls, its gravitational potential energy is transformed into mechanical kinetic energy. This transformation continues as water flows from higher to lower level on the land. Thermal energy is also transferred to the atmosphere through friction as precipitation falls.**
- ***Evaporation*- When water absorbs the sun's energy, the molecules begin to move faster as the solar energy is transformed into thermal energy. If enough solar energy is transformed, water evaporates from Earth's surface. It enters the atmosphere as water vapor, bringing the thermal energy with it.**
- ***Transpiration*- In transpiration plants take up water from ground or bodies of water. In the case of aquatic plants and release into the atmosphere as water vapor like evaporation, transpiration moves thermal energy into the atmosphere.**

**High temperature Increase the evaporation of water and capacity of air to hold water vapor.**
$$
↑Temperature↑Watervapor↑HoldAbility

**Solar energy drives the water cycle and sustains life on the Earth by providing energy for photosynthesis**
**Solar energy made up by electromagnetic radiation of *different wavelengths*.**	**These waves transformed into *thermal energy* when they interact with matter.**	**About *half* of this energy enters the Earth's atmosphere, while visible light tends to pass through the atmosphere and reach the Earth's surface unchanged.**
**When it reaches the Earth's surface, it is converted into *thermal energy*. It is then radiated into the surroundings in the form of *Infrared radiation*.**
**It temporarily transfers part of the energy and heat, which plays an important role in the warming of the atmosphere.**

76.      Conduction

**After land and water absorb solar energy, the molecules collide more frequently with air molecules close to the surface.**
**This collisions transfer thermal energy as a result of temperature of the lower air comes close to the land temperature This *triggers convection*.**

77.      Convection

**Convection occurs as the lower layer of the air warms from conduction**
$$

**Earth's vast ocean can store a vast amount of thermal energy with very little change in temperature. Ocean transfer and radiate energy to their colder surroundings. This happened slowly.**
**Without this effect, the Earth would experience *radical shifts* in temperature between day and night. It would also be much *hotter in the summer* and much *colder in the winter*.**
