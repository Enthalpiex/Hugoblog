## Hard to start?

I find that many times I canâ€™t start something because there is so much resistance that stops me. Since this I decided to find reasons out and trying to avoid it.

I'm curious that where is the resistance comes from, and why it appears. Instead, I find following majority reasons, and I listed some solutions or examples I had now.
### Fear

Fear is considered to be a survival instinct of human beings since ancient times. This instinct could help to protect individuals when they see the unknow beast, and they will run away.

Same as the modern people, when individuals meets a unknow thing, they will instinctively flee rather than fight.

`Solution: Break down the target into small steps, see what needs to be done in each step (for example, writing an article requires different paragraphs), and make an outline to know everything you need to do. `

`Sometimes a long outline itself can cause fear, so start by focusing on a specific section and giving it a suitable deadline is a good choice. Although deadlines are the first productivity, overly strict deadlines can cause fear and prevent from taking actions. Deadline can be brought forward after the start (e.g. to cut the time in half to improve efficiency), but it cannot be postponed.`

`If the above doesn't work, it means the subdivisions are not simple enough. So try to repeat the above steps for each subdivitions until they do not cause any stress or burden.`

`For tasks with a fixed deadline, try to at least cut the time in half to be more efficient. If the fixed deadline itself is difficult to accomplish, try to start working on it once everything are listed.`
### Risk, cost and benefits are not equal, or unpredictable

Almost all things have their corresponding sacrifice. Usually time, money, and energy. All things and experience are exchanging between the individual and the world, use currencies above.

People are forced to pay something so most of them couldn't accept failure. If they fail, they lose all the stuff they invested. For most people, the benefits are limited, but everything they put in makes them feel physically or psychologically uncomfortable.

Because of this, people tend to choose stop, or even avoid to start due trying to avoid predictable risks, which is a part of the survival instinct.

For most things, the total amount of things completed remains the same, the time is reduced, and the energy spent is increased. So there is a limit to the sum of time and energy. 

Although this sum is limited, the different distribution of the two will greatly affect the ability to act. More energy and shorter time will cause fear, vice versa. This is because compare to the time, energy limit is more obvious and easier to feel. Less time also refers to have less time to resolve unexpected issues, which stands for bigger risks.

`Solution: Give a looser deadline at the beginning to reduce fear, move deadline forward after start to increase efficiency.`

`For those things doesn't have high benefits relatively, find out its urgency and significance to replace the benefits part. If none of the above is true, avoid doing this useless thing.`
### Unclear direction

Some individuals may have a big goal but many without details. Not enough details refers unknow, which means fear.

Instead, unclear direction will stop people to trying to start because they don't know where and how to start.

`Solution: Break things down into enough detail and make an outline so you know what needs to be done and how to get started.`

`For unknown parts, search to obtain content and solutions, calculating impacts.`
### Not interesting

The brain likes interesting things and dislikes boring things. When people have more interesting options, the brain will try to choose the interesting thing that is useless, rather than the useful but boring thing.

Many things are indeed useful, but the way they are done is boring, so psychological resistance will be generated to try to prevent them.

`Solution: Find a more interesting way to finish the thing.`

`If the most efficient way to do the thing is not interesting, reduce relative fun. For example, reduce entertainment or ban cell phones (Reduce activities that are considered the most interesting to narrow the gap between the fun of doing serious work and entertainment. A smaller gap will produce less resistance when doing serious work).`

`All above can be summed up in one sentence:"Make the life pure."`
## Conclusion 

4 Majority reasons: Fear, Risk, cost and benefits are not equal, or unpredictable, Unclear direction, Not interesting.

`Solutions:`

`1. Break down the goal and form the outline.`

`2. Give a looser deadline at the beginning to reduce fear, move deadline forward after start to increase efficiency.`

`3. Avoid doing useless thing.`

`4. Searching for unknow parts of plan and fill out the outline.`

`5. Find a more interesting way to finish the thing.`

`6. Reduce relative fun and make the life pure.`
