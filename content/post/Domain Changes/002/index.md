>**Dear User,**
>
>We regret to inform you that due to domain abuse and other related issues, after extensive discussions with the **.KG registry**, **ccltd.kg will no longer be allowed to receive any complaint reports**—otherwise, the **.KG registry will permanently disable domain resolution.**
>
> US.KG Domains: Current Situation
>
>Although **US.KG DNS resolution has been temporarily re-enabled**, please be aware that **if any further complaints are received, the .KG registry will immediately revoke DNS resolution again.** This restriction is beyond our control, as it is an official policy of the **.KG registry**, not a decision made by us.
>
>As a result, we are **forced to suspend all US.KG domain resolutions**, and the ability to register new US.KG domains has been **disabled**. We, **DigitalPlat FreeDomain**, are also victims of this policy change and understand the inconvenience this may cause. Despite this setback, we are actively seeking better and more stable alternatives to continue providing free domain services.
>
> Migration to a New Domain: DPDNS.ORG
> 
>To ensure service continuity, we are **introducing a new domain: dpdns.org**.  
>- **For example:** If your previous domain was `example.us.kg`, your account will be **automatically switched** to `example.dpdns.org` once the new system is ready.  
 >
>Important Notice:
>- **dpdns.org is still under testing** and is **NOT available for resolution, management, or new registrations yet.**  
>- Please **wait for our official announcement** before making any changes.  

Due to abuse, US.KG has stopped serving. This website will be moved to dpdns.org. `entropiex.us.kg` will be replaced by `entropiex.dpdns.org`.
