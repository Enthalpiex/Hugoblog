>The free subdomain provider US.KG has once again been temporarily suspended from resolving by the Kyrgyzstan registry.
>The reason for the suspension remains consistent with the previous instance: the free nature of the domain has attracted numerous cybercriminal gangs using it to create phishing and malicious websites.  
>Typically, domain registries take action upon receiving excessive complaints, which can include suspending resolution, seizing, and reclaiming domains.

Since DigitalPlat has suspended domain name resolution, the website will temporarily use the original Github Pages domain name (enthalpiex.github.io).
