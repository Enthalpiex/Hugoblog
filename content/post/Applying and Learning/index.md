When I do some review of my past life, it's pretty easy to find that I spend more time on learning, but not applying. Is this because I'm still a student, or I'm good at applying? It's hard to find out the answer immediately. 

I think this could state for two possible reasons:

1. I have sort of talent on applying

2. I am lack of applying

In the same time, I think the question really depends on individual's experiences. Difficulty is a qualitative question rather than a quantitative one. Maybe I can try more practice and applying stuff such as do more projects. 

Advance forever. Happy applying!
