**Eccirian** is a security-focused Obsidian encryption plugin that supports seamless encryption and decryption of files using multiple advanced password-based encryption methods. 

It introduces a custom `.eccirian` file extension and provides a unique read-only view for locked files, allowing you to easily manage sensitive information directly in Obsidian.
