In the MWI framework, every possible self you may become and every possible fate you may experience already "exists" in the universe, but they belong to different branching world lines.

Therefore, in the process of entering and exiting world lines, through the control of thoughts, we can select and strengthen the path weights of certain world lines, so that life experience tends towards those realities.

Every thought, emotion, intention, and belief is a "offset" operation on a certain world line. It all starts from the moment consciousness comes into the world.

- Positive, confident, and determined thinking → makes you more likely to move towards a world with positive results;
- Fear, doubt, and self-denial → make you biased towards the branch with low probability and negative results;

This also means that when you decide to start taking control of your thoughts, you first need to face the thoughts you have had for decades, which have shaped your reality today.

Since consciousness actually moves in and out of different world lines, we can see that thoughts not only choose/create reality, thoughts are reality.

Because our thoughts determine what world-lines we enter into. So if we are thinking wonderful thoughts, and are calm, and direct our energy into wonderful things, our life would be wonderful.

But if we surround ourselves with negative thoughts, manipulative news, and people. If we are reacting to events instead of manifesting them, or if we hold grudges and evil negative thoughts, then our world experiences will become progressively darker.

Thoughts create memories, and memories influence thoughts.

A poverty stricken beggar might yearn for a reality where he has a warm meal and a roof over his head from the rain. While a wealthy oligarch might yearn for forbidden activities, and serendipitous pursuits.

This difference is due to their experiences, which are shaped by their memories. 

People discovered this phenomenon and named it the Law of Attraction. In fact, directed thoughts determine their reality.
