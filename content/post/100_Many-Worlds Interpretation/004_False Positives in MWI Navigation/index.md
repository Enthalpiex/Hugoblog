One thing that can be pretty common in an intention campaign is the presence of “false positives”.

False positives are events or things that appear to match your verbal affirmations in substance, but have some glaring defect that makes them unusable.

Like ripples in a pond, a target object or situation can often create “ghost” or “echo” images. These items are not necessarily exactly what you are striving for. Though, it might (truthfully) be exactly what you are asking for.

For example, if the navigation goal is "live in a brand new white room, eat whatever you want, close to the sea", the target reality may be:
- You live in a brand new seaside prison, but the food there is good
- You become a sailor and spend most of your time in a white cabin

Of course, it is not impossible to become a food tycoon and live in a seaside villa. But if no restrictions are set, the navigation direction will be towards the world line that is closest and most likely.

A false positive is that you have become a food industry tycoon and live in a beachfront villa, but
- Your villa is very humid, and the sea breeze causes water and salt to cover the walls
- The shrinking food industry has caused you to be heavily in debt
- There is no beach at the beach, and there are strong winds and huge waves all year round

At this point, the goal seems to have been achieved, but there are many problems. At this time, you need to make a course correction and make necessary adjustments to some details. The good news is that a false positive means that you have reached the world line cluster where the goal is located. By modifying the content of the Affirmation and spending more time, reality will get closer to the goal:

- The house is comfortable
- The climate here is pleasant
- The industry is booming

Finally, time passes, and you get where you want to go.
