In classical conceptions of time travel, particularly within a single-timeline universe, the grandfather paradox poses a serious logical problem: if a person travels back in time and prevents their grandfather from having children, how could the time traveler have been born to commit the act in the first place?

We can see that the grandfather paradox assumes two premises:
1. We live in a shared reality
2. The reality of the past and the future is the same, and all events are caused by cause and effect

Obviously, these two assumptions are not correct.

## Time Travel Under MWI

**Many-Worlds Interpretation (MWI)** of quantum mechanics offers a fundamentally different framework that avoids such paradoxes altogether.

The MWI posits that every quantum event with multiple possible outcomes causes the universe to split into multiple, non-interacting branches, each representing a different outcome.

Traditional MWI theory holds that the universe does not have a single timeline, but an infinite "tree" composed of divergent world lines. In fact, it is more likely that all the divergent world lines themselves have always existed and formed a "grid" in which consciousness constantly shuttles.

If time travel is possible in such a framework, then the traveler is not moving backwards along a single timeline. We know that the traveler is actually constantly traveling between worldlines, so their arrival in the "past" will result in the creation or intersection of a new worldline, a parallel branch that diverges from the point of arrival.

In this branching structure, meeting a version of your past self is plausible. However, the "you" that exists in that past is not the exact same entity that became the future traveler. Rather, it is a copy on a parallel worldline. The moment you travel back, you create or join a branch where both versions of you co-exist, and their timelines may continue independently.

However, we also know that shadow people do not have a dominant consciousness, which means you will meet your shadow people.
## Why the Grandfather Paradox Doesn't Occur

Because of this branching, any actions taken in the "past" do not overwrite the traveler's origin timeline. If you were to stop your grandfather from having children in that new branch, it would not affect the original branch from which you came. Instead, it would only change the course of history in that particular parallel world. 

In this way, causality is preserved within each branch, and no contradictions arise. The original sequence of events that led to your birth remains intact in your original worldline, even if you prevent it in another.

In other words, your shadow copy has no logical connection with you. 
## Conclusion

In our MWI framework, there is only one dominant consciousness, so even if the dominant consciousness returns to the world lines it has been to, it will only encounter its own "shadow man". This will not cause the dominant consciousness to suddenly visit itself in its memory, because the dominant consciousness returns to that world line after it has experienced that world line. The dominant consciousness's memory will not change because it does not have the experience of the "shadow man" on the world line it returned to. 

Therefore, in theory, there is nothing wrong with killing your grandfather. Furthermore, if your grandfather has passed away, then you have not actually killed anyone, because at this time all "grandfathers" are just empty shells, and the dominant consciousness has left.

In MWI, time travel is as easy as moving around in the three-dimensional world.
