# Introduction

This document aims to systematically organize and summarize the core concepts related to the Many Worlds Interpretation (MWI) to help build a more complete understanding of the nature of reality. To facilitate thinking and communication, several simplified models and analogies are used in this document. These expressions strive to be close to reality, but they do not represent the only or final explanation. Please note: reality is far more complex than the model, and you should avoid construction as much as possible when reading this document.
