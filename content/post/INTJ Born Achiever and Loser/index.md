## Pathway of an INTJ
### Lower stage

In the lower stage, the INTJ usually presents as a being weaker than ordinary people. They have extraordinary self-confidence and arrogance, look down on everything, are introverted, like to think about problems but often dare not really be independent, their grades cannot crush their classmates, they have not carried out large-scale learning and self-discipline, and their thoughts are not objective, materialistic, and practical. They have no ability to counteract these huge side effects of being an INTJ.
### Transition L-M

After experiencing a mental transformation (usually a breakdown and remodeling) caused by long-term thinking, they realize that arrogance and coldness are not conducive to achieving their goals, so they try to become more humble and use personality masks. As they gradually have a concept of their goals and the path in between, INTJs at this stage will improve their ability to act and their thirst for knowledge.
### Middle stage

A middle stage INTJ possesses high intelligence, deep philosophical thinking, and strong self-discipline. They can analyze most things clearly and independently resolve various peculiar thoughts. Having dedicated thousands or even tens of thousands of hours to learning, they have developed exceptional decision-making, judgment, and perception through extensive reading, far surpassing the accuracy of ordinary individuals. Their academic performance and achievements exceed those of most peers. Becoming more social and communicative, fearless in standing out, and establish rules and order for their teams. Able to control time and energy in certain extent.
### Transition M-H

This stage has approached or achieved success in a secular sense, and after several years of development, has made outstanding contributions or achievements in a specific field. Gradually, they have acquired high-level rationality and the ability to predict the times, breaking free from the limitations of emotional and physical basic feedback.
### Higher stage

Higher stage INTJs are built on top rationality, understand the laws of the world, have accurate long-term prediction capabilities, learning abilities, and terrifying execution capabilities. High stage INTJs are only limited by their physical and time limits, so they usually reach the pinnacle in a field, can thoroughly study the things they love and influence others, can soar to the sky in good times, and can turn the tide in bad times. They dare to be unique and are not afraid of power.

## "置之死地而后生"

People like and admire INTJs, but only high-level INTJs. Their decisiveness, perseverance, and courage are highly praised, and their near-absolute rationality is called a miracle. However, the more perfect these abilities are, the deeper the gap between the middle and high levels is. The M-H stage will be a hurdle that most people will never be able to cross in their lifetime, and it is also the stage that only a few top entrepreneurs, politicians, and financial tycoons can overcome.

INTJ's aversion to stupidity and their own arrogance make them more accepted by society the higher they are. For lower- and middle-stage INTJs, accepting the reality of being weak, being open-minded and objective, studying as diligently as possible, and always being optimistic are the only ways to reach a higher level.

## Interesting vs. Meaningful
### External rules and influences

INTJ's instinct is to pursue efficiency. If they don't see the meaning of something, they won't even take a second look at it in order to "maximize efficiency." However, what many people think of as "meaningful" is actually based on external rules, such as getting into a good school, finding a good job, and winning social recognition. These are value systems defined by others, and are "finite games" that will eventually fall into endless competition.
### Finite games vs. infinite games

The goal of a finite game is to win, so the rules are clear and there are many competitors, leading to involution. The goal of an infinite game is to continue and explore, and the rules can be created, so the competitive pressure is much smaller. INTJs have the advantages of systematic thinking and strategic planning, and can completely choose not to get involved in the established track, but to establish their own game rules, enter the “wilderness”, and open up their own path.

### Find something that is truly “interesting”

INTJs tend to execute efficiently, but their thinking framework is often driven by external goals, which easily leads to them just optimizing the existing system and ignoring the possibility of creating a new system. To find something “interesting”, the key is to slow down, return to life, and observe which things can make you invest in it for a long time even without external rewards. In other words, if something doesn't need external recognition and you're still willing to work on it, then it may be worth pursuing.

### The value of time

For INTJs, time is the most valuable resource. The real strategy is not to fight for a tiny advantage in a highly competitive race, but to find areas that have not yet been noticed by the mainstream, set your own rules there, and become a rule maker rather than a passive player in the game. This not only improves the return on investment (ROI), but also conforms to INTJ's long-term planning mindset.

## Supplement

In business, breadth is a cost, and depth is a profit. For INTJs, the requirements are even more stringent. They must be both generalists and experts, understand all walks of life, and be the best in their own profession. This puts a double test on time and body, which is one of the reasons why top successful people are so rare.
