In simple models and complex models, as long as the simple model is consistent with the results, its confidence is much higher than that of the complex model. When this gap is infinitely magnified by multiple parameters, from the perspective of Bayesian probability, the simple model is either directly rejected, but as long as it can roughly match the experimental data, it is better than the complex model.

This includes 2 parts:
### Occam's Razor and Bayesianism

**Occam's Razor** and **Bayesianism** are two important principles in reasoning and scientific philosophy. Occam’s Razor emphasizes **simplicity**, favoring explanations that introduce the fewest unnecessary assumptions. Bayesianism, on the other hand, focuses on probabilistic reasoning, continuously updating our beliefs based on new evidence. 
### Occam’s Razor: Favoring Simpler Explanations

Occam’s Razor states that **when multiple explanations exist, the simplest one is usually the best**. This idea was introduced by the 14th-century philosopher **William of Ockham**, who argued that we should avoid unnecessary complexity in our reasoning.

For example, if a strange noise is heard at night, one could assume either:

1. It was caused by the wind.
2. It was caused by ghosts moving objects around the house.

Occam’s Razor suggests choosing the first explanation because it relies on well-understood natural causes rather than introducing additional, unproven assumptions. While simplicity alone does not guarantee correctness, it often leads to more practical and testable theories.

### Bayesianism: Updating Beliefs Based on Evidence

Bayesianism is a way of reasoning that helps us refine our beliefs as we gather more information. Instead of treating ideas as either absolutely true or false, it considers different possibilities and adjusts how likely each one is based on new evidence.

For instance, if a doctor suspects a patient has a certain illness, they do not immediately confirm it. Instead, they look at symptoms, test results, and medical history, gradually becoming more confident in a diagnosis as more information is gathered.  
If new evidence contradicts the initial assumption, the doctor revises their belief and considers other possibilities.

This method is widely used in fields such as science, machine learning, and even everyday decision-making. It allows us to make better predictions and avoid jumping to conclusions too quickly.

### The Relationship Between O. and B.

1. **More complex explanations usually have lower initial credibility.** When we lack strong evidence, it makes sense to assume simpler explanations are more likely, aligning with Occam’s Razor.
2. **Bayesian reasoning naturally favors simpler theories unless the evidence strongly supports a more complex one.** If two explanations fit the data equally well, the simpler one is usually more likely to be correct.
