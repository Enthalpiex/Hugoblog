Directivity system α has been finalized and archived. Timeflip will remake and update all previous content.

Directivity system α is the first attempt to manage time based on the latest theoretical results, and has gained a lot of data and experience. Timeflip is a reset and updated version of D.s. α to solve many of its problems, expand the management scope, and greatly optimize the tediousness.
## Theoretical basis

- Timeflp will continue the characteristics of D.s. α, systematize the results, and use Result list to replace Todo list

- Unlike D.s. α, goal setting will not be excluded, and Timeline will be used to solve intuitive problems

- Introduce the concept of time frame, preview & **review**
- Cancel the concept of Bar
