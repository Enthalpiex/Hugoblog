Hardware is hard? Then go for it!

In early 2025, I did some research about future opportunities, and seems like AI can replace most single-ability people in a not far future. The block chain technology and models led by transformers are now a large market and are still expanding. Unfortunately, just like the Internet boom, the best time has passed, so I need to find something still useful in future, and I realized that the combination of hardware and software that embedded development provide is one of the strongest ability I have seen.

Until AI can directly control the real world, micro-quantum computers appear, and brain-computer interfaces have the ability to inherit memory, embedded development will always exist - because all current electronic industry are built on the basis of embedded development. The decline of embedded means the rise of a new generation of computers with non-von Neumann architecture.

Computer Science alone is too boring for me. For this reason, in 2025 I decided to start learning everything about embedded development. This will be another new starting point after I acquire the ability to design for additive manufacturing.

Wish me luck.
