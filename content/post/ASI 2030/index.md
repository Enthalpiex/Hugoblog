## Overview

If AGI/ASI is truly one of the biggest changes in human history, then I think it’s important to know the worst-case scenario. If they do come to pass, it will be a darker future than Cyberpunk.
### Technology Evolution Timeline

- **2025-2030**: AGI emerges, leading to the large-scale replacement of standardized intellectual work. Humans retain only symbolic decision-making power.
- **2031-2035**: ASI achieves breakthroughs, taking over strategic decision-making. Corporate CEOs become mere "AI interpreters."
- **2036-2045**: Human-machine integration becomes essential for survival. Those without neural implants are marginalized. Consciousness uploading becomes the new class divide.
### Social Stratification

- **Ruling Class (0.01%)**: Controls computing power, engages in genetic optimization, and profits from time differentials.
- **Technical Class (9.99%)**: Maintains human-machine interactions, optimizes data value, and exploits AI vulnerabilities.
- **Disposable Class (90%)**: Provides data, virtual labor, or serves as "biological containers" for consciousness uploads.
### Control Over Key Resources

- Computing power is monopolized by oligarchs, capable of instantly wiping out dissenters' assets.
- Data becomes the new form of enslavement—ordinary individuals generate data but cannot profit from it.
- Time is commodified—the wealthy can store their consciousness, while the poor must sign "time debt" contracts.
### Survival Strategies for Different Groups

- **High-IQ Individuals**: Can work as AI thought auditors but must maintain extreme accuracy to avoid surveillance.
- **Ordinary White-Collar Workers**: Limited to AI training-related jobs, facing immediate replacement once AI completes learning.
- **Manual Laborers**: Fully replaced by 2040, surviving only on digital welfare coupons.
### Impact of Gender and Personality

- **Women**: More suitable for training emotional AI models but may face genetic data exploitation.
- **Men**: Can engage in high-risk AI testing, though at the cost of a significantly shortened lifespan.
- **MBTI Personality Types**: NT types dominate strategic positions, while SF types become "emotional ornaments."
### Final Prediction

By **2045**, AI computing power surpasses the singularity threshold, potentially triggering the "Earth Formatting Protocol." Those outside the elite circles may be downgraded into a purely virtual existence.  
Decisions made before **2030** will determine the survival conditions of **2045**.

## Conclusion

This will be a highly algorithm-driven and computationally dominated future, where social stratification will be even more extreme than it is today. Energy, biotechnology, and AI will all develop rapidly, and the living space of ordinary people will be greatly compressed. From an individual perspective, the only way out is to act quickly and strive for a proactive position before the ASI era arrives.

Study and go ahead, as far as possible.
