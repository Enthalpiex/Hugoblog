`Some thoughts on perfectionism and farsightedness`

Some thoughts on perfectionism and farsightedness

Living in the peaceful years, no one will take risks anymore.

I realize that sometimes we must have a promise; so that you will not retreat, give up, or be at a loss at any time; let it be like a laser to clear the riddle and guide the direction; the past time can never be obtained, because history is pushed forward.

Time rotates, but by the time you realize the rotation, it is too late. Fallen leaves return to their roots, but the evergreen trees in the south will not fall because of autumn. The imperfection of the world is the best gift for perfectionists; when you fall into reincarnation, it is the day when the promise is fulfilled.

This is a story, a story written from today; it will explain everything about me, where and why I do it: Make everything interesting, joyful and meaningful. Let memories become happy things, and let experience become the only evidence. When the goal is the extreme, you have to push everything higher.

This is a four-dimensional space, and I am a human living on a three-dimensional slice. Whether for civilization or individuals, only thinking from a higher dimension can solve those unimaginable or even unproposed problems - but they exist objectively, resulting in imperfection. This is time slicing. In the three-dimensional world, a cube can be easily unfolded into a flat white paper with one face, and vice versa; in the three-dimensional world, a MÃ¶bius strip can be easily created to splice two completely isolated two-dimensional worlds. In the four-dimensional world, everything in the three-dimensional world pales in comparison, so as long as the time dimension is controlled, all problems will be solved, and the originally difficult problems become easy.

Time is set to be one-way, redshift will not stop, and entropy increase will not end. Locking the flow of time greatly reduces the operating space, but it only locks the direction, so it can still be compensated to a certain extent by changing the flow rate and efficiency. This is time slicing, a new way of time management: It will truly describe this four-dimensional space.

Make memories an enjoyment, not a regret. Let time leave footprints, not cracks.
