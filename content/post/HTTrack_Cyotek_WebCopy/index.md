I'm trying to sort out some blogs that might disappear at any time. I have two options.

When it comes to downloading entire websites for offline browsing, HTTrack and Cyotek WebCopy are two of the most well-known tools. They have both been out of update for many years.

I had an absolutely terrible experience with Cyotek WebCopy, which seemed to be newer, but somehow downloaded many times slower than HTTrack. The crawler depth setting was too rigid, and if the website structure was too flat (most blogs), there would be some scanning issues.

Unfortunately, we don't have a replacement.

| Feature                      | **HTTrack**                       | **Cyotek WebCopy**                 |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| First Released               | 1998                              | 2013                               |
| Last Update                  | 2017                              | 2023                               |
| Open Source                  | Yes (GPL licensed)                | No                                 |
| Platform                     | Windows, Linux, macOS (via Wine)  | Windows only                       |
| User Interface               | Outdated, functional              | Clean                              |
| Custom URL Include/Exclude   | Powerful (wildcards, filters)     | Available, but harder to configure |
| Login Form Support           | Manual cookie handling required   | Basic form-based login supported   |
| Speed & Connection Control   | Highly customizable               | Minimal options                    |
| Command Line Support         | Full command-line interface       | GUI only                           |
| Export/Import Configurations | Supports `.opt` files             | No configuration export            |
| Speed                        | Faster (configurable parallelism) | Slower (fewer threads)             |

Neither tool supports JavaScript-rendered sites very well. We really need new website downloading tools - not these two decades-old antiques that continue to work.
