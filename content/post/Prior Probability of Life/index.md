Today is the last day of September. Looking back, this month has passed very quickly and I have learned a lot. The most important thing is to establish the White Room system, and thinking about the life.

According to Bayesian theory, life should also consist of prior probability and posterior probability. Being alive and healthy constitutes the prior probability, while thoughts and actions constitute the posterior probability. When all conditions are met, it is the road to victory.

For the coming month, I decided to finish my high school physics content and improve my English, everything will be checked on my birthday.

Happy October!
