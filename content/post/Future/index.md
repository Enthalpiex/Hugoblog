It's January again! Happy new year to you all guys!

Today's electronic products are thinner and lighter than before, but they are still very heavy, especially those laptops with good performance that weigh more than one kilogram. Today’s quantum computers are larger and heavier than traditional computers—they are housed in specific rooms and run.

This prompts us to ask: what kinds of products could define the future? Can we experience the same level of excitement as we did with groundbreaking releases like the MacBook or the iPhone X?

One promising candidate is AR glasses powered by directional beam charging technology. Currently, most AR glasses fail to replace smartphones, primarily due to their weight, with bulky batteries being the main culprit. Since this, if we can cancel the battery and use a power bank to charge, also replace the wire to wireless RF (radio frequency) technology, such as millimeter-wave directional transmission, all above problems will be solved. 

The biggest challenges are: heating problem, high energy consumption ratio chip and High-resolution transparent display.

The same technology has the potential to revolutionize aerospace. Traditional space elevators are constrained by material limitations. By eliminating these materials and instead using ion thrusters with vector control to maintain a fixed orbit, coupled with wireless RF technology for power transmission, we could bypass these constraints entirely.

This would pave the way for a low-Earth orbit transportation method far more efficient than traditional rockets.

The future of technology is brimming with possibilities, although we feel like the technological progress has gradually slowed down or even stalled, but in fact there are still many conceptual technologies that have not been widely used.
